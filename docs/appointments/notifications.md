# Notifications & Reminders

## Why This Matters
Messages keep clients informed and reduce no‑shows. Clear rules ensure confirmations, reminders, cancellations, and surveys reach the right person at the right time.

## What Sends Messages
- Verification: after checkout, the client receives a link to confirm the booking group. Verifying moves bookings from Pending to Customer Confirmed.
- Confirmation: when a booking becomes Confirmed (manually or via auto‑confirmation), a confirmation message can be sent.
- Reminders: upcoming Confirmed bookings trigger reminders based on your settings.
- Cancellation: when a booking is cancelled, a cancellation message can be sent.
- Surveys: after a booking is Finished, a survey request can be sent if surveys are enabled.

## Channels and Timing
- Email: used for verification, confirmations, cancellations, and surveys.
- SMS: used for reminders when SMS is enabled for your team.
- Typical timing: email often goes out about a day in advance; SMS is typically closer to start time. Exact timing follows your configuration.
- Timezone: all schedules use your team’s timezone.
- Duplicate protection: the system avoids sending multiple reminders for the same booking and window.

## Preconditions
- Status: reminders send only for Confirmed bookings. Pending and Customer Confirmed do not receive reminders.
- Contact details: emails require a valid address; SMS requires a valid mobile number.
- Settings: enabling surveys starts requests after appointments finish; enabling SMS allows text reminders.
- Timezone: reminders are scheduled using your team’s timezone; rescheduling adjusts to the new time automatically.

## What Happens After Changes
- Move from Pending to Customer Confirmed: verification succeeded; teams may auto‑confirm next.
- Confirm a booking: confirmation messages can send; reminders are scheduled.
- Reschedule or reassign staff: confirmations remain valid; reminders adjust to the new time.
- Cancel a booking: cancellation messages send; any scheduled reminders stop.
- Finish a booking: surveys may send shortly after completion; analytics refresh.

## How To Use It
- Verification
  - Ask clients to check their email after checkout and click the link.
  - Consider enabling auto‑confirmation to streamline verified groups.
- Confirmations
  - Confirm manually when needed; confirmations help clients trust their schedule.
- Reminders
  - Enable SMS to reduce no‑shows for same‑day visits.
  - Keep emails accurate; verify addresses promptly.
- Cancellations
  - Cancel through the app so customers are notified and calendars update.
- Surveys
  - Enable auto‑send in Organization Settings to gather feedback consistently.

## Example Scenarios
- Standard booking
  - Client completes checkout and verifies the group.
  - Team auto‑confirms the booking.
  - The client receives a confirmation and later a reminder.
- Reschedule
  - A Confirmed booking changes time.
  - The reminder adjusts to the new schedule.
  - The client receives the reminder based on the updated time.
- Cancellation
  - A Confirmed booking is cancelled.
  - The client receives a cancellation message.
  - No reminders are sent for the cancelled visit.
- Group booking
  - Multiple services are grouped under one verification.
  - Confirmation applies to the whole group.
  - Each visit in the group receives reminders according to its own start time.

## Tips & Warnings
- Keep team timezone aligned with your operating location to avoid off‑by‑time confusion.
- Verify email addresses promptly; disposable or unverified emails reduce delivery success.
- Enable SMS only if your number collection is reliable.
- Confirm promptly so reminders can be scheduled without last‑minute rush.

## Why This Matters
A predictable notification system keeps your schedule stable and your clients informed. By tying messages to status changes and using your team’s timezone, you avoid miscommunication and reduce missed appointments.
