# Common Appointment Tasks



## Book a New Appointment
- When to use: adding a visit for a customer.
- Steps:
  - Open Appointments → Create Appointment.
  - Select Date, Service, Customer, and Professional.
  - Choose Available Slots or enter a Custom Time, then validate.
  - Add Promo Code (optional).
  - Set Status:
    - Use Confirmed for staff‑created bookings so reminders and calendar sync run.
    - Online checkout creates Pending; customer email verification moves it to Customer Confirmed and teams may auto‑confirm to Confirmed.
  - Add Notes if needed.
  - Review the summary and click Create Appointment.
- Tips:
  - Services drive time and price; pick add-ons carefully.
  - For a past visit, use Custom Time and validate conflicts.

## Reschedule an Appointment
- When to use: change time or staff.
- Steps:
  - Open the appointment → Edit.
  - Pick a new date/time and professional.
  - Save changes; confirmed appointments will have updated calendar events and future reminders.
- Tips:
  - Available slots show future times with a short buffer; use Custom Time if you must record a past visit.
  - Reminders send only when status is Confirmed.

## Cancel an Appointment
- When to use: customer request or no-show policy.
- Steps:
  - Open the appointment → change Status to Cancelled.
  - Confirm; a cancellation notice is sent if emails are enabled.
- Tips:
  - Follow your policy on cancellation windows and fees.

## Set Up Recurring Appointments
- When to use: regular visits (weekly, monthly).
- Options:
  - Calendar Sync: create a recurring event in Google or Microsoft Calendar and let MyScheduly sync it into appointments.
  - Manual Series: create appointments on future dates using the Create form for each occurrence.
- Tips:
  - Check synced occurrences in Appointments and adjust exceptions (holidays, travel).
  - Ensure calendar connections are active before relying on recurring events.

## Manage Appointment Reminders
- When to use: keep customers informed and reduce no-shows.
- How it works:
  - Reminders are sent ahead of time by email or SMS when enabled.
  - Keep customer email and phone current to ensure delivery.
- Steps:
  - Confirm the appointment status is Confirmed (Customer Confirmed does not send reminders unless auto‑confirmed).
  - Verify the customer’s contact info is correct.
  - Check Appointments list for upcoming reminders.
- Tips:
  - Ask customers to check spam for emails.
  - If SMS is used, ensure phone numbers include the correct country code.
