# Managing Reviews

## Why This Matters
Collecting feedback is only the first step. Actively managing your reviews—approving them for display and replying to clients—shows that you care about their experience. It also helps you control your public reputation.

## Viewing Your Reviews
To see what clients are saying:
1.  Navigate to the **Surveys** or **Reviews** tab in your dashboard.
2.  You will see a list of all reviews, sorted by date (newest first).

Each entry shows:
-   Client Name
-   Star Rating
-   Date of Service
-   Written Comments (if any)
-   Status (Published, Pending, Rejected)

## Moderating Reviews
Depending on your configuration, some reviews might need your attention before they appear on your website.

### Approving a Review
If a review is in the **Pending** state (usually because it fell below your auto-publish threshold or you use manual moderation):
1.  Click **Approve** on the review card.
2.  **Result:** The review immediately becomes visible on your public booking page.

### Rejecting a Review
If a review is spam, inappropriate, or you simply don't want it public:
1.  Click **Reject** (or "Hide").
2.  **Result:** The review remains in your internal dashboard for your reference but will **never** be shown to the public. The client is *not* notified that you hid their review.

## Replying to Clients
You can reply to reviews to thank clients or address concerns.

1.  Click **Reply** on the review.
2.  Type your message.
3.  Send.

**Note:** Replies are typically public if the review is public. A professional, kind reply to a negative review can sometimes be more impressive to potential clients than a perfect 5-star rating.

## Best Practices for Management
-   **Check Weekly:** even if you use auto-publish, check your dashboard weekly to catch any low ratings that didn't go public.
-   **Reply to Low Scores:** If a client rates you poorly, use the internal contact details to reach out privately first.
-   **Don't Hide Everything:** A profile with only 5-star reviews can look fake. A few 4-star reviews with polite management responses add authenticity.

## Example Scenario
**Situation:** A client leaves a 3-star review saying "Great cut, but I waited 20 minutes."
**Action:**
1.  You see the review is **Pending** (because your rule is 4+ stars).
2.  You decide to **Approve** it anyway because it's honest.
3.  You **Reply**: "Thanks for the feedback! We're sorry about the wait and are adjusting our schedule to fix this."
**Outcome:** Future clients see that you own your mistakes and care about punctuality.
