# Analyzing Feedback

## Why This Matters
Survey Analytics turns individual opinions into clear trends. Instead of guessing how your business is doing, you can use data to spot exactly where your team shines and where they need support. This guide explains how to read your metrics and take action.

## Key Metrics

### Response Rate
The percentage of finished appointments that resulted in a survey.
-   **What it tells you:** Are enough clients seeing your survey?
-   **Goal:** Higher is better. If it's low (< 10%), consider mentioning the survey to clients before they leave.

### Average Rating
Your overall satisfaction score (out of 5).
-   **What it tells you:** The general sentiment of your client base.
-   **Goal:** A healthy business usually tracks above 4.5.

### Would Recommend
The percentage of clients who answered "Yes" to recommending you.
-   **What it tells you:** Your potential for organic growth (word-of-mouth).
-   **Goal:** This is often your most important metric for long-term success.

## Understanding Criteria Ratings
MyScheduly tracks specific areas so you know *what* to fix.

-   **Business Experience:**
    -   **Customer Service:** Was the staff friendly and helpful?
    -   **Cleanliness:** Was the facility tidy?
    -   **Punctuality:** Did the appointment start on time?
    -   **Service Quality:** Was the actual service performed well?
-   **App Experience:**
    -   **Ease of Use / Booking:** How easy was it to make the appointment?

## How to Analyze Performance

### 1. Spotting Trends
Don't panic over one bad week. Look at the **Rating Distribution** over a month.
-   Are 5-star reviews increasing? Great, keep doing what you're doing.
-   Are 3-star reviews creeping up? Check the comments to find the common thread (e.g., "parking was hard," "music was too loud").

### 2. Connecting Scores to Comments
Numbers tell you *what* happened; comments tell you *why*.
-   **Scenario:** Punctuality score drops.
-   **Check Comments:** Clients might say, "Waited 15 mins."
-   **Action:** Adjust your booking buffers or staff schedules.

### 3. Staff Training
Use specific criteria to guide your team.
-   If **Cleanliness** is low, implement a new cleaning checklist.
-   If **Customer Service** is high, celebrate with the team!

## Common Questions
**Q: My analytics look flat or empty.**
**A:** You might not have enough data yet. Analytics need a minimum number of responses to generate meaningful charts. Keep collecting!

**Q: Do rejected reviews count in analytics?**
**A:** Yes. Analytics reflect *all* feedback received, even if you chose not to display the review publicly. This ensures you have an honest view of your business performance.
