# Troubleshooting Surveys

## Why This Matters
When surveys aren't working as expected, you miss out on valuable feedback. This guide helps you resolve common issues quickly.

## Common Issues

### Surveys Are Not Sending
**Symptoms:** Appointments are finished, but clients aren't receiving emails.
**Checks:**
1.  **Is Auto-Send enabled?** Go to **Organization Settings > Surveys** and confirm the toggle is ON.
2.  **Is the appointment "Finished"?** Surveys only trigger when the appointment status changes to `Finished`. If it's stuck in `Confirmed` or `Arrived`, the survey won't send.
3.  **Is the client email correct?** Check the customer profile for typos.

### Reviews Are Not Appearing on Website
**Symptoms:** You received a new review notification, but it's not on your booking page.
**Checks:**
1.  **Check Moderation Status:** The review might be "Pending". Go to your Reviews dashboard and approve it.
2.  **Check Public Display Setting:** Ensure **Show Reviews on Booking Page** is enabled in settings.
3.  **Check the Rating:** If you have auto-publish set to "4 stars and up," a 3-star review will wait for manual approval.

### Analytics Look Empty
**Symptoms:** You have reviews, but the charts are blank or flat.
**Checks:**
1.  **Timeframe:** Ensure you've selected a date range that includes the recent reviews.
2.  **Data Volume:** Some charts require a minimum number of data points to render useful curves. If you only have 1 or 2 reviews, the "trend" lines might not appear yet.

### "Verification Failed" Error
**Symptoms:** A client complains they can't submit the survey.
**Checks:**
1.  **Link Expiry:** Survey links may expire after a certain period (e.g., 7-14 days) to ensure feedback is relevant.
2.  **Already Submitted:** A client can only submit a survey once per appointment ID.

## Still Stuck?
If you've checked all the above and still have issues, please contact support with:
-   The specific Appointment ID.
-   The client's email address.
-   A description of what happened.
