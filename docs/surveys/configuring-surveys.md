# Configuring Surveys

## Why This Matters
Before you can collect feedback, you need to tell MyScheduly when to send surveys and how to handle the results. Correct configuration ensures clients receive surveys at the right time and that your public profile displays only the reviews you want to show.

## 1. Enabling Auto-Send
The most reliable way to collect feedback is to send surveys automatically after every appointment.

1.  Go to **Organization Settings**.
2.  Find the **Surveys** section.
3.  Toggle **Enable Auto-Send** to ON.

**What Happens Next:**
-   MyScheduly monitors your appointments.
-   When an appointment status changes to `Finished`, the system queues a survey email.
-   The email is sent to the client shortly after the visit (usually within minutes).

## 2. Setting Moderation Rules
Moderation rules determine which reviews appear on your public profile automatically and which ones require your approval.

### Option A: Auto-Publish High Ratings (Recommended)
You can set a threshold (e.g., 4 stars) so that positive reviews go live immediately.

1.  In **Organization Settings** > **Surveys**, look for **Moderation**.
2.  Select **Auto-publish**.
3.  Choose a minimum star rating (e.g., "4 stars and above").

**Result:**
-   Reviews with 4 or 5 stars appear on your website instantly.
-   Reviews with 1, 2, or 3 stars stay in a "Pending" state until you manually approve them.

### Option B: Manual Approval
If you want to read every review before it goes public, choose this option.

1.  Select **Manual Approval** for all reviews.

**Result:**
-   No review appears on your website until you click "Approve" in the dashboard.
-   This gives you maximum control but requires more daily management.

## 3. Displaying Reviews on Your Website
You can choose whether to show your collected reviews on your public booking page.

1.  In **Organization Settings** > **Surveys**, find **Public Display**.
2.  Toggle **Show Reviews on Booking Page** to ON.

**Why do this?**
-   Social proof builds trust with new clients.
-   A high star rating next to your business name encourages bookings.

## Example Configuration
**Goal:** Low-maintenance setup that highlights good service but catches complaints.

-   **Auto-Send:** ON
-   **Moderation:** Auto-publish 4 stars and above.
-   **Public Display:** ON

**Outcome:** Your best reviews market your business automatically. If a client has a bad experience (e.g., 2 stars), the review is hidden until you see it, giving you a chance to reach out to the client first.

## Tips & Warnings
-   **Changing Rules:** If you switch from "Manual" to "Auto-publish", existing pending reviews that meet the criteria will NOT automatically publish; the rule applies to *new* reviews.
-   **Privacy:** Only the client's first name and initial are shown publicly to protect their privacy.
