# Survey Analytics

Last updated: 2025-11-27

## Feature Overview
Survey Analytics helps you understand customer satisfaction and spot opportunities to improve. It summarizes feedback collected from the survey form into easy‑to‑read metrics and visuals. Managers use it to guide training and promotions; staff use it to see how clients feel about recent visits.

MyScheduly uses a fixed set of survey criteria so results stay consistent over time. These cover two areas:
- Business Experience: Customer Service, Cleanliness, Service Quality, Punctuality
- App Experience: Ease of Use, Booking Process

## How It Behaves
- Live updates: after a client submits feedback or when an appointment moves to `finished`, analytics refresh within minutes. Caching keeps the view fast and is automatically cleared by events.
- What feeds analytics: the overall star rating, “Would Recommend”, the fixed criteria above, and any comments all roll up into the analytics views.
- Scope of data: this view summarizes all feedback from finished appointments for your team. It does not include per‑service or per‑staff filters in this screen.
- Safe handling: with few responses, charts can look flat. Keep collecting feedback to build a clearer picture.

## What You’ll See
- Response Rate: the percentage of finished appointments that received feedback. Higher rates mean you’re hearing from more clients.
- Average Rating (out of 5): overall satisfaction score. Aim for 4.5+ as a healthy benchmark.
- Would Recommend: the percentage of clients who said “Yes” to recommending you. Strong recommendation rates help growth.
- Criteria Ratings: averages for the fixed criteria listed above, shown with stars and helpful context.
- Rating Distribution: how many 5‑star, 4‑star, 3‑star, 2‑star, and 1‑star ratings you received in the selected period.
- Recent Feedback: comments that provide context behind the numbers.

## How To Use It
- Collect feedback
  - Ask clients to complete the survey after their appointment.
  - Criteria are predefined by MyScheduly. Encourage clients to rate each area and share comments.
- Read the analytics
  - Review the main metrics (Response Rate, Average Rating, Would Recommend) to understand overall sentiment.
  - Check Criteria Ratings to see what’s working and what needs attention.
  - Scan Recent Feedback to understand the “why” behind the scores.
- Act on insights
  - If a criterion dips, review comments and coach the team on that area.
  - If recommendation rises, highlight the practices that led to success.

## Example Scenario
You notice Average Rating dropped to 4.1.
- Criteria Ratings show Punctuality below your usual level.
- Comments mention longer waiting times on Saturday.
- You adjust staffing for peak hours and add a check‑in process.
- Next week, Average Rating climbs back to 4.6 and Would Recommend improves.

## Best Practices
- Encourage responses: send a friendly reminder within 24 hours of the appointment.
- Know the criteria: Customer Service, Cleanliness, Service Quality, Punctuality, Ease of Use, Booking Process.
- Combine numbers with comments: scores tell you “what”, comments reveal “why”.
- Watch sample sizes: small numbers can swing metrics quickly. Use longer periods for stability when reviewing trends.
- Close the loop: share improvements with staff and celebrate wins to keep momentum.

## What Happens When You Change Settings
- Auto Survey Send
  - When you enable automatic sending in the organization settings, surveys go out after appointments finish. This typically raises your response rate. Changes apply to new appointments; past analytics stay the same.
- Survey criteria
  - Criteria are fixed in MyScheduly to ensure consistent tracking over time.
- Visibility and moderation
  - If your team moderates reviews or auto‑publishes above a minimum rating, this affects which comments appear publicly. Analytics metrics include all survey responses.

## Tips & Warnings
- If nothing appears, it likely means there are no survey responses yet for your team. Keep encouraging clients and check back later.
- A sudden drop in Average Rating often indicates a specific operational issue (timing, supplies, communication). Use comments to pinpoint it.
- Aim for a consistent feedback cadence; sporadic requests create gaps and make trends harder to read.

## Why This Matters
Survey Analytics turns client feedback into clear actions. The fixed criteria give you a consistent baseline, and as clients submit surveys and appointments finish, results update within minutes so you can respond quickly. Over time, these insights help you improve service quality, retain clients, and grow through recommendations.
