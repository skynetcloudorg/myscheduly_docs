# Surveys — Overview

## Why This Matters
Surveys capture how clients feel after their visit. When set up correctly, they send at the right time, publish what you want on your website, and feed analytics so you can spot trends and improve service.

## How It Behaves
- Auto‑send: when enabled, surveys go out shortly after an appointment is marked Finished.
- Fixed criteria: clients rate preset areas (for example, Customer Service, Cleanliness, Service Quality, Punctuality, Ease of Use, Booking).
- Moderation: you choose whether reviews auto‑publish above a minimum rating or require manual approval.
- Website display: you can allow approved reviews to appear on your public page.
- Analytics: as responses arrive and appointments finish, analytics refresh within minutes.

## Setup
- Enable auto‑send
  - Turn on automatic survey sending in Organization Settings.
  - Surveys begin sending after appointments are Finished.
- Choose moderation strategy
  - Auto‑publish above a minimum rating.
  - Manual approval for every review.
- Enable website display (optional)
  - Allow approved reviews to appear on your public page.
  - You can change this later without losing collected feedback.

## What Happens After Changes
- Turning on auto‑send: new Finished appointments trigger survey requests; past analytics remain unchanged.
- Changing moderation strategy: future reviews follow the new rules; existing published reviews stay as they are until you update them.
- Enabling website display: approved reviews start appearing on your public page; disabling hides them without deleting data.

## How To Use It
- Encourage responses
  - Remind clients to watch for the survey after their visit.
  - Explain that it helps improve service.
- Review feedback
  - Check overall rating and “Would Recommend”.
  - Read comments to understand context.
- Act on insights
  - Coach the team on areas with lower scores.
  - Share wins when ratings improve.

## Example Scenario
You enable auto‑send and set auto‑publish for ratings 4 and up.
- After finishing appointments, surveys go out automatically.
- Positive reviews appear on your website without manual work.
- Lower ratings wait for your review; you reply and coach the team.
- Analytics show rising “Would Recommend”, reinforcing good practices.

## Tips & Warnings
- Keep moderation realistic: auto‑publish saves time but manual review helps control tone.
- Expect slower updates with few responses; build momentum over time.
- If you change display settings, give it a day for the public page to reflect updates consistently.

## Why This Matters
With auto‑send, moderation, and website display set correctly, surveys become a reliable signal of client satisfaction. They update quickly after visits and help you respond to feedback in a structured, consistent way.
