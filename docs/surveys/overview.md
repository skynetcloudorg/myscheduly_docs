# Surveys — Overview

## Why This Matters
Understanding how your clients feel is the key to growth. MyScheduly's Survey system automates the feedback loop, allowing you to capture ratings, display social proof on your website, and spot trends in service quality.

Instead of manually asking every client, the system handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on the results.

## How It Works
1.  **Collection:** The system automatically emails clients after their appointment is marked "Finished".
2.  **Moderation:** You decide which reviews go public instantly and which ones need approval.
3.  **Display:** Approved reviews appear on your public booking page to build trust.
4.  **Analysis:** All data feeds into a dashboard to help you improve your business.
