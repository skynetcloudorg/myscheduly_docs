# Team Settings

Team Settings manage the people and subscription behind your business. This is where you set the team name and public URL, invite members, assign roles, and track plan limits. It does not change your public page’s design or content—that lives in Organization Settings.

## Team Name & URL
Changing the team name updates how your team appears across the app. Changing the URL (slug) changes the address of your public page. After saving, share the new link with clients because old bookmarks will no longer reach your page.

URL rules:
- Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Minimum 3 characters, maximum 63 characters
- Some words are reserved and cannot be used (for example, admin)
- If a URL is already taken or reserved, you’ll be asked to choose another

## Members & Roles
Adding members allows staff to collaborate. When you invite someone, the invitation counts toward your member limit until it is accepted or canceled. Once a member joins, you can assign roles to control what they can do (for example, manage settings, view appointments, or administer the team). Removing a member immediately frees one member slot.

If you reach your member limit, invite and add controls become unavailable. Upgrading your plan increases the limit; canceling unused invitations or removing members also frees capacity.

## Invitations
Pending invitations show who has been invited but not yet joined. You can resend invitations after a cooldown period (typically 24 hours) or cancel them. Canceling an invitation removes it from your usage and lets you invite someone else.

## Plans, Quotas, and Usage
Your plan defines how many teams you can create and how many members you can add. Usage counts both active members and pending invitations. Remaining shows how much capacity is left.

When you hit a limit, actions that would exceed it are blocked. Upgrading increases limits immediately. Downgrading reduces limits; if your current usage is above the new limits, you need to remove teams or members before adding more.

## Create or Delete Team
Creating a new team uses one team slot from your plan. If you have room, you can create teams for different brands or locations. After creation, you’ll land on that team’s page to start setup.

Deleting a team is permanent and removes its public page. Do this only when you’re certain you no longer need the team. If you delete a team, its slot becomes available again in your plan. For sub‑teams, staff who had that team as their current team are switched to an available team when possible.

## Permissions and Ownership
Roles decide who can invite members, change roles, or manage the team’s details. The owner has the highest level of control, including subscription changes. Staff cannot access organization settings. If you need wider access for a staff member, assign a role with the appropriate permissions rather than sharing owner access.

## How Changes Affect Your Operations
- Team name and URL updates take effect as soon as you save.
- Invitations and role changes apply immediately to access and permissions.
- Plan changes affect limits right away—upgrade to unlock more capacity, downgrade to reduce it.

## Before You Share Your Link
- Confirm your new URL works and update the link wherever it is shared.
- Check that roles match staff responsibilities.
- Review pending invitations; cancel any no‑longer needed to free capacity.
- Verify you are within plan limits for teams and members.
- If you plan to grow, consider upgrading before inviting more staff.

## Common Pitfalls
- Changing the URL without updating links causes clients to reach an old or invalid page.
- Pending invitations count toward member limits until accepted or canceled.
- Resending invitations too frequently is throttled; wait for the cooldown.
- Downgrading while above the new limits requires reducing teams or members first.
