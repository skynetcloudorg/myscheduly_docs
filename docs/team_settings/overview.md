# Team Settings

Team Settings is the administrative heart of your account. While **Organization Settings** controls your public face, **Team Settings** controls your internal operations: your people, your plan, and your identity.

## Why This Matters

This module determines:
*   **Who is on the bus:** Invite staff and manage their access.
*   **What they can do:** Assign roles (Owner, Manager, Staff) to protect sensitive data.
*   **How you pay:** Manage your subscription plan and billing limits.
*   **Where you live:** Set your unique Team URL (`myscheduly.com/your-name`).

## What's in This Section

We have broken down the administration guide into these key topics:

*   **[Team Basics](./team-basics):** How to name your team, set your URL, and understand the consequences of changing them.
*   **[Member Management](./member-management):** A guide to inviting colleagues, managing pending invitations, and removing staff.
*   **[Plans & Billing](./plans-billing):** Understand your quotas (how many staff you can add) and how to upgrade or downgrade safely.
*   **[Permissions Matrix](./permissions):** A clear table showing exactly what Owners, Managers, and Staff can and cannot do.

## Key Actions
*   **Invite Member:** Add a new stylist or receptionist to your team.
*   **Change Role:** Promote a staff member to Manager.
*   **Update URL:** Change your public booking link (Use with caution!).
*   **Check Usage:** See how close you are to your plan's member limit.

Start by setting up your **[Team Basics](./team-basics)**.
