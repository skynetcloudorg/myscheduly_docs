# Team Basics

Your **Team** is the core entity in MyScheduly. It represents your business, your staff, and your brand. This section explains how to configure the fundamental identity of your team.

## Team Name
This is the internal name displayed in the dashboard and in emails to your staff.
*   **Example:** "Downtown Salon" or "Dr. Smith's Clinic".
*   **Changing it:** You can update this at any time. It updates immediately across the app.

## Public Team URL
This is the web address where clients go to book appointments.
*   **Format:** `myscheduly.com/your-team-name`
*   **Rules:**
    *   Must be unique (no two teams can share a URL).
    *   Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
    *   Minimum 3 characters.

### ⚠️ Important Warning on URL Changes
If you change your Team URL after sharing it with clients:
1.  **Old links will break:** Anyone clicking the old link will see a "Page Not Found" error.
2.  **Update everywhere:** You must manually update your Instagram bio, website buttons, and email signatures.
3.  **Best Practice:** Pick a URL you love early on and stick with it.

## Deleting a Team
Deleting a team is a destructive action.
*   **What is lost:** All appointments, customer records, staff accounts, and settings associated with that team.
*   **Recovery:** This cannot be undone.
*   **Subscription:** Deleting a team frees up a "Team Slot" in your plan, allowing you to create a fresh one if needed.
