# Member Management

You can't do it all alone. Member Management allows you to invite staff, assign roles, and control who has access to your business data.

## Inviting New Members

To add a colleague to your team:
1.  Go to **Team Settings > Members**.
2.  Click **Invite Member**.
3.  Enter their email address.
4.  Select a Role (see below).
5.  Send Invitation.

**Status:**
*   `Pending`: The email has been sent, but they haven't clicked the link yet.
*   `Active`: They have joined the team.

**Note:** A "Pending" invitation still counts toward your plan's member limit. If someone doesn't accept, cancel the invite to free up the slot.

## Managing Roles

Roles define what a user can see and do. You can change a member's role at any time.

*   **Changing Roles:** Click the "Edit" icon next to a member's name and select a new role. The change happens immediately.
*   **Removing Members:** If a staff member leaves, remove them from the team to revoke their access instantly. Their past appointments remain in the system for your records.

## Plan Limits

Your subscription determines how many people can be on your team.
*   **Quota:** displayed as `Active Members / Total Limit` (e.g., 3/5).
*   **Full Team:** If you reach your limit, the "Invite" button will be disabled. You must either upgrade your plan or remove an existing member to add someone new.
