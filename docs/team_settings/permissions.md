# Permissions & Visibility — Matrix

## Why This Matters
Clear permissions protect sensitive data and keep each person focused on what they need. Understanding access helps you assign roles correctly and explain why certain buttons or totals are hidden.

## Roles
- Owner: full control, including Organization Settings, publish to live, and subscription management.
- Manager: broad operational control; can manage appointments, customers, services, vouchers, and often see team metrics.
- Staff: focused on their own schedule; limited access to system‑wide settings and financial summaries.

## Modules and Access
- Organization Settings
  - Owners can Save Draft, Preview, and Publish to live.
  - Managers and Staff can view; they cannot publish.
- Appointments
  - Staff can create and update appointments where they are the assigned professional; they cannot delete appointments.
  - Managers and Owners can manage all team appointments, including deletion.
  - Reminders send only for Confirmed bookings.
- Customers
  - Staff, Managers, and Owners can view all customers in the team.
  - Managers and Owners see all customers.
- Dashboard
  - Staff see their schedule and operational metrics; financial cards are hidden.
  - Managers and Owners see team‑wide metrics, including financial cards.
- Vouchers & Gift Cards
  - Managers and Owners create, edit, and deactivate.
  - Staff apply codes during checkout.
- Calendar Integration
  - Each person connects their own calendar and manages their own sync.
  - Managers and Owners can guide provider setup. Connect one provider at a time to avoid conflicts.
- Surveys & Reviews
  - Owners and Managers control auto‑send, moderation, and website display.
  - Staff can view results; publishing controls remain limited.
- Team Settings
  - Owners manage subscriptions, team URL, invitations, and roles.
  - Managers may assist with members and roles depending on your setup.

## What Happens After Role Changes
- Increasing access: new permissions take effect immediately; hidden menus, buttons, and totals appear.
- Reducing access: restricted areas disappear from menus; users keep access to their own appointments and profile.

## Practical Guidance
- Assign Owner only to those who need publishing control and subscription management.
- Use Manager to oversee daily operations without exposing organization‑wide publishing.
- Keep Staff focused on their schedule to reduce mistakes and protect sensitive data.

## Why This Matters
When roles match responsibilities, your team moves faster and sensitive information stays protected. This structure also reduces errors in publishing and keeps financial visibility aligned with policy.
