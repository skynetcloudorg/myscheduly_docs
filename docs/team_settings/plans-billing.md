# Plans & Billing

## Why This Matters
Your subscription fuels your business growth. This section explains how to manage your plan, update payment methods, access invoices, and understand your resource quotas.

## Understanding Quotas
Your plan comes with specific limits on resources:
*   **Team Limit:** How many separate business entities you can manage (e.g., multiple locations).
*   **Member Limit:** How many staff accounts you can have per team.

**Tracking Usage:**
You can see your current usage bar in the **Team Settings** dashboard. It shows exactly how close you are to your limit.

## Managing Your Subscription

### Upgrading
Need more staff or features?
1.  Go to **Team Settings > Billing**.
2.  Select a higher tier plan.
3.  **Effect:** Limits increase immediately. You can invite more members right away.
4.  **Billing:** You will be charged the prorated difference for the remainder of the current billing cycle.

### Downgrading
Need to cut costs?
1.  Go to **Team Settings > Billing**.
2.  Select a lower tier plan.
3.  **Constraint:** You cannot downgrade if your *current* usage exceeds the *new* plan's limits.
    *   *Example:* If you have 5 staff members, you cannot switch to a plan that allows only 3.
    *   *Fix:* Remove 2 members first, then downgrade.

### Billing Cycle
*   **Renewal:** Plans renew automatically (monthly or annually) based on your selection.
*   **Failed Payments:** If a payment fails (e.g., expired card), the system will retry for a few days. A grace period is provided before account access is restricted.

## Payment Methods
You can keep your payment information up to date to avoid service interruption.

### Updating Your Card
1.  Navigate to the **Billing** tab.
2.  Look for the **Payment Method** section.
3.  Click **Update Card** (or "Add Payment Method").
4.  Enter your new credit card details and save.
5.  **Note:** The new card will be used for all future renewals.

## Invoices
For accounting and tax purposes, you can access your billing history at any time.

### Downloading Invoices
1.  Go to **Team Settings > Billing**.
2.  Scroll to the **Invoice History** section.
3.  You will see a list of all past payments.
4.  Click the **Download** (or PDF icon) next to any date to get the official invoice.
5.  *Tip:* Invoices are also automatically emailed to the Team Owner after every successful payment.

## Cancellation
We’re sorry to see you go. If you need to stop your subscription:

1.  Go to **Team Settings > Billing**.
2.  Click **Cancel Subscription** (usually at the bottom of the page).
3.  **Effect:**
    *   Your premium features remain active until the end of the *current* billing period.
    *   After the period ends, your account may revert to a "Free" or "Read-Only" state depending on the platform's policy.
    *   **Data Retention:** Your data is kept for a limited time in case you decide to reactivate. To permanently delete everything immediately, see [Account Deletion](../profile/account-management.md).

## Trial Period
If you are on a Free Trial:
*   **Duration:** You have full access to all premium features for the trial duration (typically 14 days).
*   **Expiry:**
    *   If you do not add a payment method, your account will be locked when the trial expires.
