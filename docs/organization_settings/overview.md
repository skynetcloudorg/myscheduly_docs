# Organization Settings

Organization Settings control how your public booking page looks and behaves. Most changes are saved to a Draft first, so you can safely prepare and Preview your work before you Publish it. The only exception is Live Mode, which switches visibility immediately.

Changing settings here affects what clients see and how bookings work. After you Publish your draft, the public page and booking flow update right away.

## Permissions
Why this matters: it protects your live page and bookings.
Only team owners can Save Draft, Preview, Publish, and switch Live Mode. If you do not own the team, you can view the settings and the Preview, but you cannot change or publish them.

## General & Appointments
General defines your timezone, language, and currency, and sets booking rules. When you change the timezone and Publish, appointment times display in the new timezone across your site and pages. New bookings follow the new timezone immediately; existing future appointments are shown to you and your clients in that timezone, keeping the same intended local time.

Buffer Time adds a gap between bookings to protect your schedule. Increasing it reduces the number of back‑to‑back slots shown to clients; decreasing it opens more availability. Auto Confirm automatically approves incoming bookings, so they appear as confirmed without manual action. This reduces administration, but you should ensure your external calendar sync is enabled to avoid overlap. These rules take effect for new bookings after you Publish.

## Appearance
Appearance controls colors, logo, and favicon. Adjusting your palette updates the Preview immediately so you can see how your page will look. Uploading a logo or favicon adds branding to the header and browser tab. Once you Publish, visitors see the new visual style on the live page.

## Media Behavior
Why this matters: images and logos define your brand.
- Draft uploads appear only in Preview until you Publish.
- Replacing a logo, hero image, or gallery item updates it everywhere after Publish.
- Removing an image in Draft deletes it from Preview and, after Publish, from the live page.
- Publishing cleans up unused draft images to keep storage tidy.

## Content
Content manages your Hero image, About section, Gallery, and Why Choose Us. Changing text updates messaging; uploading images refreshes visuals. Gallery additions or removals change what clients can browse; removing an image deletes it from your draft and, after Publish, from the live page as well. Publish to make your story and visuals available to visitors.

## Business Hours
Business Hours define when clients can book. Only days with both a start and end time are treated as open. If you clear a day’s time, that day becomes closed and will not appear in the booking widget. Holidays block bookings on specific dates. After you Publish, your available slots update immediately based on your schedule and holidays.

## Contact & Social
Contact shows address, phone, email, website, and maps link; Social adds links to profiles like Instagram or TikTok. Updating these fields refreshes the public contact section. Publish to make the changes visible to clients and ensure your links open correctly.

## Surveys & Reviews
Surveys can automatically request feedback after appointments. When enabled and Published, the system starts sending survey requests based on your activity. Your Review Publishing Strategy controls how reviews appear: auto‑publish above a chosen rating, manual approval for every review, or collect without auto‑publishing. If you enable display on your website, approved reviews appear on your public page once Published.

## SEO
SEO settings affect how search engines and social platforms show your page. Updating the title and description changes the text shown in search results. Social preview fields (Open Graph/Twitter) control the title, description, and image used when your link is shared. The sitemap tool can generate an up‑to‑date sitemap to help search engines index your content. After Publish, these changes apply; note that search and social platforms may cache older previews for a while.

## Live Mode
Live Mode switches your public page ON or OFF. Turning it ON makes your page visible to clients; turning it OFF shows an “under construction” message. This change applies immediately and does not require Publish. Use it when you need privacy while you prepare a new draft.

## Interconnections
Why this matters: organization settings affect multiple parts of your system.
- Timezone changes how dates and times are shown in booking, staff views, and notifications. Future appointments keep their intended local time‑of‑day in the new timezone.
- Business Hours and Buffer Time control which slots appear to clients. New bookings follow updated rules after Publish; existing appointments remain as scheduled.
- Contact & Social details appear on the public page and in shareable links and emails.
- Surveys & Reviews determine post‑appointment feedback and what reviews can appear on your website.
- SEO title, description, and social preview influence how your page looks in search and when shared; platforms may cache older previews.

## Getting Started with Notifications
Why this matters: timely messages reduce no‑shows and keep clients informed.
- Enable Email: verify your team email and collect valid customer emails. Confirmation and cancellation messages send based on booking status and your policies.
- Enable SMS Reminders: turn on SMS reminders if available for your team and ensure customer phone numbers are present. Reminders use your team timezone and typically send closer to start time.
- Enable Survey Auto‑Send: turn on automatic surveys so feedback requests go out after appointments are Finished. Choose a moderation strategy and decide whether approved reviews appear on your website.
- What happens after changes: Verified bookings can auto‑confirm; Confirmed bookings receive reminders; cancelled bookings send notices; Finished bookings trigger surveys.

## How Changes Become Visible
- Everything except Live Mode goes to Draft first and becomes public only after you Publish.
- Preview lets you review your Draft safely before publishing.
- Draft uploads are visible only in Preview; customers never see them.
- Publish updates the live page and booking behavior right away and clears the Draft.
- Publishing also removes unused draft images to keep storage tidy.

## Common Scenarios
- Refresh your brand: update colors, logo, hero image, and gallery; use Preview; Publish when satisfied.
- Change working hours: adjust Business Hours and Buffer Time; Preview available slots; Publish to update the booking widget.
- Move to a new timezone: set the new timezone; check that upcoming appointments display at the intended local time; Publish; review external calendar sync.
- Hide your page temporarily: turn Live Mode OFF; make changes safely in Draft; turn Live Mode ON when ready.

## Before You Publish
- Check timezone and confirm business hours reflect your local schedule.
- Review buffer time and auto‑confirm settings to match your workflow.
- Verify colors offer good contrast; confirm logo and favicon are clear.
- Ensure Hero, About, and Gallery look correct and load quickly.
- Confirm address, phone, email, website, and map link are accurate.
- Test social links open the right profiles.
- Decide your survey and review publishing strategy and enable display if desired.
- Set SEO title and description; upload a social preview image if available.
- Use Preview to review the full page end‑to‑end.
- Turn Live ON only when you’re ready for visitors.

## After Publishing
- The live page updates immediately.
