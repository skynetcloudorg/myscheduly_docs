# Organization Settings

Organization Settings is the control panel for your public booking page. This is where you define how you look to the world and how your business operates.

## Why This Matters

These settings control:
*   **Your Brand:** Colors, logos, and images that make your page look professional.
*   **Your Availability:** Business hours and buffer times that protect your schedule.
*   **Your Rules:** Currency, timezones, and auto-confirmation logic.
*   **Your Reputation:** How reviews and feedback are collected and displayed.

## What's in This Section

We have organized the settings into logical guides:

*   **[General & Booking Rules](./general-settings):** Configure the essentials like Timezone, Currency, Auto-Confirm, and Buffer Times.
*   **[Branding & Content](./branding-content):** Customize your visual identity with logos, hero images, gallery photos, and SEO settings.
*   **[Engagement Tools](./engagement-tools):** Set up social links, contact info, and manage your customer review strategy.
*   **[Draft vs. Live Workflow](./draft-publish-workflow):** Understand how to safely preview changes before publishing them to your live site.

## Quick Start Tips
1.  **Set your Timezone first.** This avoids scheduling confusion later.
2.  **Upload a Logo.** It instantly makes your page look trustworthy.
3.  **Check Business Hours.** Ensure they match your actual availability.
4.  **Use "Preview".** Always check your changes in the preview window before clicking Publish.

Start by configuring your **[General Settings](./general-settings)**.
