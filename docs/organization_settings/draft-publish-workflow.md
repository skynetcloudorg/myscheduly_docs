# Draft vs. Live Workflow

To prevent customers from seeing half-finished changes, Organization Settings uses a **Draft** system. This allows you to work on your page safely behind the scenes.

## How It Works

1.  **Make Changes:** When you edit text, upload photos, or change colors, you are editing a **Draft**.
2.  **Preview:** The preview window shows you exactly what the draft looks like. Your live public page remains unchanged.
3.  **Publish:** When you click **Publish**, your draft changes are pushed to the live website instantly.

**Safety Net:** If you upload a photo but don't like it, you can simply remove it from the draft. No one saw it.

## Live Mode Toggle

There is a master switch for your entire booking page: **Live Mode**.

*   **ON:** Your booking page is visible to the public. Clients can visit the URL and make appointments.
*   **OFF:** Your booking page is hidden. Visitors will see a "Under Maintenance" or "Coming Soon" message.

**When to use OFF:**
*   When you are first setting up and aren't ready for bookings.
*   If you are doing a major rebrand and want to hide the site for an hour.
*   If you are closing the business temporarily.

## Permissions

Who can change these settings?
*   **Team Owners:** Have full access to Save Drafts, Publish, and toggle Live Mode.
*   **Staff:** Can view the settings and the preview but **cannot** publish changes. This protects your brand from accidental edits.
