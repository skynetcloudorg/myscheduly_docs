# Engagement Tools

Turn a one-time booking into a lasting relationship using these engagement features.

## Contact & Social Links

Make it easy for clients to find you elsewhere.
*   **Contact Info:** Ensure your phone, email, and physical address are accurate. These appear in the footer and on booking confirmations.
*   **Social Profiles:** Add links to your Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook.
    *   *Why:* Clients often want to see more photos of your work on social media before booking.

## Reviews & Surveys

Feedback is the breakfast of champions. MyScheduly automates the collection process.

### Automated Surveys
*   **How it works:** When an appointment status changes to `Finished`, the system can automatically send an email asking for feedback.
*   **Enable/Disable:** You can turn this feature on or off.

### Review Publishing Strategy
You decide how reviews appear on your public page.
1.  **Auto-Publish:** Reviews above a certain star rating (e.g., 4 or 5 stars) appear automatically. Lower ratings require approval.
2.  **Manual Approval:** You must personally approve *every* review before it goes public.
3.  **Collect Only:** You gather feedback for internal use, but nothing is shown publicly.

**Pro Tip:** Displaying reviews increases trust. Even a few 4-star reviews make your business look authentic and reliable.
