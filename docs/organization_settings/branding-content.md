# Branding & Content

Your booking page is often the first interaction a client has with your business. Use these settings to make it look professional and trustworthy.

## Visual Identity

### Colors
*   **Primary Color:** Used for buttons, links, and key highlights. Pick a color that matches your logo or brand theme.
*   **Preview:** As you adjust the color picker, the preview pane updates instantly so you can verify contrast and readability.

### Logo & Favicon
*   **Logo:** Appears at the top of your booking page. Use a transparent PNG for the best look.
*   **Favicon:** The small icon that appears in the browser tab. It helps clients find your page among their open tabs.

## Page Content

### Hero Image
This is the large, welcoming image at the top of your page.
*   **Tip:** Choose a high-quality photo of your shop, your team, or a happy client. Avoid blurry or dark images.

### About Section
Tell your story.
*   **What to write:** Who are you? What makes your service special? How long have you been in business?
*   **Why it matters:** Personal stories build trust with new clients who haven't met you yet.

### Gallery
Show, don't just tell.
*   **Upload:** Add photos of your best work (e.g., haircuts, nail art, massage room).
*   **Management:** You can add or remove images at any time. Remember to **Publish** your changes for them to appear live.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Help Google find you.
*   **Page Title:** The text that appears in Google search results (e.g., "Downtown Spa - Best Massage in City").
*   **Description:** A short summary (1-2 sentences) that encourages people to click.
*   **Social Preview:** The image that appears when someone shares your link on Facebook or WhatsApp.
