# Welcome to MyScheduly

Your documentation is organized for day-to-day operation. Start with the quick setup, then follow the training paths based on your role.

## Quick Start
- Set up your team: [Team Settings](./team_settings/overview)
- Configure your public page and booking rules: [Organization Settings](./organization_settings/overview)
- Create services and link add-ons: [Services](./services/overview), [Service Add-ons](./service_addons/overview)
- Connect your calendar (Google or Microsoft): [Calendar Integration](./calendar/overview)
- Learn appointments and statuses: [Appointments](./appointments/overview)
- Enable notifications and surveys: [Notifications & Reminders](./appointments/notifications), [Surveys](./surveys/overview)

## Key Workflows
- [Checkout & Sequential Scheduling](./appointments/checkout_flow)
- [Notifications & Reminders](./appointments/notifications)
- [Calendar Sync Rules](./calendar/sync_rules)
- [Vouchers & Gift Cards](./vouchers/overview)
- [Dashboard Overview](./dashboard/overview)

## How the System Behaves
- Status lifecycle: Pending → Customer Confirmed → Confirmed → Finished (Cancelled any time). Reminders send only for Confirmed.
- Timezone: scheduling, reminders, and sync use your team’s timezone for consistency.
- Sequential scheduling: multi‑service visits are arranged back‑to‑back, respecting Business Hours and Buffer Time.
- Vouchers: discounts apply immediately; multi‑item carts use proportional distribution; gift card remainders stay available.
- Calendar sync: Confirmed bookings create/update external events; external events appear as blocked time.
