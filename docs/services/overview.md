# Services

Version: 1.0.29 | Last updated: 2025-11-27

## Why This Matters
Services define what you sell and how long each appointment takes. Accurate price and duration keep your schedule realistic and your billing correct. Clear provider assignments ensure customers only see staff who can deliver the service.

## When You Use It
- Publish offerings for customers to book online or in-store.
- Set prices and durations used in appointments.
- Assign qualified providers for each service.
- Control whether services are visible publicly.

## What Happens After Changes
- Changing Duration updates time slot calculations and conflict checks.
- Updating Price changes billing totals and revenue metrics.
- Adjusting providers affects who appears in booking forms and who can view/update the service.
- Hiding a service removes it from public booking until you’re ready.

## Feature Connections
- Appointments: total duration combines the service time with any selected add‑ons. Availability checks use this combined time to suggest slots and prevent overlaps.
- Add‑ons: only add‑ons linked to a service appear during booking. When selected, they add time and price to the appointment.
- Permissions: staff can view/update only services they provide. Managers and owners manage all services. Staff cannot create or delete services.

## How to Use
- Open Services from your dashboard; use search and filters (category, provider).
- Click “New Service”, enter Name, Category (optional), Duration (minutes), Price, Cost (optional).
- Assign providers and set visibility; click Save.
- Click any service to view details and Edit or Delete when appropriate.

## Practical Tips
- Keep names short and clear so customers recognize them.
- Use categories to group related offerings.
- Set durations that reflect real delivery time to avoid overbooking.
- Track Cost for margins; customers do not see cost.
- Hide services while setting details; make public when ready.
