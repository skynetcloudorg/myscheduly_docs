# Services — Troubleshooting

Last updated: 2025-11-27

## Common Issues and Solutions

### I can’t find a service in the list
- Search by name and clear filters (category, provider).
- If hidden, turn on visibility to show it publicly.

### Clients don’t see a service
- Ensure Visibility is on.
- Confirm at least one provider is assigned; only assigned providers appear in booking.
- Check that your public site configuration does not hide the category.

### Price or duration looks wrong
- Open the service and verify Price and Duration; click Save.
- Review linked add‑ons that might add time or cost to appointments.

### I can’t assign a provider
- Ensure the staff member belongs to the team.
- Staff can view/update only services they’re assigned to; managers/owners manage all.

### Error when saving
- Required fields: Name, Duration, Price, Category.
- Check numbers are valid (no negative values).

### Service shows but can’t be booked
- Duration must fit within business hours; long services may not find slots.
- Ensure the provider has availability set and is not blocked by external calendar events.

### Delete fails or shows an error
- If deletion fails, hide the service instead. This retires it from future bookings without affecting past appointments.

## Tips
- Keep service names unique for easier search.
- Review provider assignments after staff changes.
- Use cost tracking to understand margins.

## Validation Checklist
- Book a test service with and without add‑ons to verify totals and time.
- Confirm assigned providers appear in booking.
