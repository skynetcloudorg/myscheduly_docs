# Calendar Sync — Troubleshooting

## Why This Matters
When sync slows or looks wrong, it affects your day. These checks help you quickly diagnose connection and timing issues so your schedule stays accurate.

## Common Issues and Fixes
- Not Connected
  - Symptom: status shows “Not Connected”.
  - Fix: click Connect and complete authorization. Disconnect any other provider first.
- Live Updates Not Appearing
  - Symptom: changes don’t show up in your external calendar.
  - Fix: use Advanced options to test or refresh live updates.
- Slow or Partial Sync
  - Symptom: some events take minutes to appear.
  - Fix: wait 1–5 minutes for the initial pass; large calendars take longer. Use Sync Now on busy days.
- Duplicate or Conflicting Edits
  - Symptom: two versions of the same event or mismatched times.
  - Fix: make changes in MyScheduly and let sync update your external calendar. Avoid editing both systems at once.
- Wrong Timezone
  - Symptom: events appear on the wrong day or at the wrong time.
  - Fix: align your external calendar’s timezone with your team’s timezone.
- Provider Switching Artifacts
  - Symptom: lingering updates after disconnect.
  - Fix: disconnect cleanly before reconnecting another provider; use Advanced options to refresh status.
- Busy Day Rate Limits
  - Symptom: occasional delays during heavy activity.
  - Fix: try again after a short pause; plan a Sync Now early on busy days.

## Preventative Tips
- Connect only one provider per user.
- Keep team and external calendar timezones aligned.
- Use Sync Now before events where scheduling is critical.
- Avoid simultaneous edits in both systems.

## What Happens After Fixes
- Reconnecting restores full sync and re‑enables live updates.
- Refreshing live updates resumes near‑real‑time changes.
- Aligning timezone clears off‑by‑day confusion.

## Why This Matters
With quick checks and clean switching, your calendar stays accurate, and your team avoids double‑booking or missed updates. These steps keep both systems in step without manual re‑entry.
