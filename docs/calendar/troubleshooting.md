# Troubleshooting

Is your calendar behaving strangely? Here are the most common issues and how to fix them quickly.

## "My appointments aren't showing up in Google/Outlook."

**Check the Status**
Go to the Calendar Integration page. Does it say "Connected"?
*   **No:** Click "Connect" and log in again. Sometimes permissions expire.
*   **Yes:** Click **Sync Now**. Wait 5 minutes and check again.

**Check the Calendar Display**
On your phone or computer, make sure you are viewing the *correct* calendar. Sometimes we have multiple accounts (work, personal, family) on one device. Ensure the checkmark is next to the account you linked to MyScheduly.

## "I'm getting double-booked!"

**Check for "All Day" Events**
Did you create an "All Day" event in your personal calendar (like a birthday) but mark it as "Free" instead of "Busy"?
*   **Fix:** In Google/Outlook, change the event status from "Free" to "Busy." MyScheduly only blocks time if you are actually marked as busy.

**Check Multiple Connections**
Did you connect the same calendar account to two different staff profiles?
*   **Fix:** Disconnect one and use a unique calendar for each staff member.

## "The times are wrong (off by a few hours)."

**Check Timezones**
This is almost always a timezone mismatch.
1.  Check your **MyScheduly** Team Timezone (in General Settings).
2.  Check your **Google/Outlook** Calendar settings.
3.  Make sure they match exactly (e.g., both are "America/New_York").

## "I changed an appointment in Google, but it didn't change in MyScheduly."

**Remember the Golden Rule**
Client appointments should be edited in **MyScheduly**.
*   **Why:** MyScheduly is the "master" for bookings. It needs to send confirmation emails and update customer records. If you just move the block in Google, MyScheduly might not know *why* it moved or if the client agreed to it.

## "It says 'Connected' but nothing is syncing."

**Refresh the Connection**
Sometimes the digital "handshake" gets broken.
1.  Click **Disconnect**.
2.  Refresh your browser page.
3.  Click **Connect** and authorize again.
This resets the system and usually solves stuck syncs.
