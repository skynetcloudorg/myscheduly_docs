# Best Practices

To keep your schedule running smoothly and avoid "where did that appointment go?" moments, follow these simple guidelines.

## 1. Use One Calendar per Staff Member
*   **The Rule:** Each staff member should connect their own unique calendar account.
*   **Why:** If two staff members connect to the *same* Google Calendar (e.g., `info@salon.com`), the system will get confused. It might think Staff A is busy because Staff B has an appointment.
*   **Solution:** Have each staff member use their own work or personal email for the connection.

## 2. Manage Timezones Carefully
*   **The Rule:** Ensure your phone/computer calendar is set to the same timezone as your business in MyScheduly.
*   **Why:** If your business is in New York (EST) but your Google Calendar is set to London (GMT), an appointment at 9:00 AM might show up at 2:00 PM, causing you to miss it.

## 3. Edit Where It Was Created
*   **Client Bookings:** Always move, reschedule, or cancel client appointments inside **MyScheduly**. Let the sync update your Google Calendar.
*   **Personal Events:** Move your gym sessions or doctor visits inside **Google/Outlook**. Let the sync update your availability in MyScheduly.
*   **Why:** This prevents "sync wars" where one system tries to overwrite the other.

## 4. Use "Sync Now" Before Busy Days
*   **The Rule:** If you know you have a fully booked day coming up, or if you just did a massive cleanup of your calendar, hit the **Sync Now** button.
*   **Why:** It forces a double-check to make sure every single slot is perfectly aligned, giving you peace of mind.

## 5. Keep Titles Clear
*   If you block time in your personal calendar for work tasks, give them clear names like "Admin Time" or "Lunch."
*   Remember, MyScheduly only reads the *time* to block availability, but having clear titles helps you when you look at your own daily view.
