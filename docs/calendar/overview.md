# Calendar Integration

The Calendar Integration connects MyScheduly to your personal calendar (Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook). This ensures that your work schedule and personal life are always in sync, preventing double bookings and missed appointments.

## Why Connect Your Calendar?

*   **Never Double Book:** If you have a dentist appointment in your personal calendar, MyScheduly will automatically block that time so clients can't book you.
*   **See Everything in One Place:** View your work appointments directly on your phone's calendar alongside your personal events.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** When a client books or cancels, your personal calendar updates instantly.
