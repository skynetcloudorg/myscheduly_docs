# Getting Connected

Connecting your personal calendar (Google or Microsoft Outlook) is the best way to ensure your schedule is accurate and you never get double-booked. This guide walks you through the simple setup process.

## Before You Start

*   **Choose One:** You can connect either a Google Calendar OR a Microsoft Calendar, not both at the same time.
*   **Check Your Timezone:** Make sure the timezone on your Google/Microsoft calendar matches the "Team Timezone" in MyScheduly. If they are different, your appointments might show up at the wrong time.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Go to Calendar Integration:** Log in to MyScheduly and navigate to the "Calendar Integration" section in your profile or settings.
2.  **Select Your Provider:** Click on the logo for **Google** or **Microsoft**.
3.  **Authorize Access:** You will be redirected to your provider's login page. Log in and grant permission for MyScheduly to view and edit your events.
    *   *Why do we need edit access?* So we can add your new client bookings directly to your personal calendar.
4.  **Wait for Initial Sync:** Once you return to MyScheduly, you will see a "Connected" status. The system immediately starts a background sync.
    *   *What happens:* We scan the last **7 days** and the next **30 days** to align everything. This usually takes 1-5 minutes.

## Managing Your Connection

Once connected, you have a few controls available:

*   **Sync Now:** If you just added a lot of events to your Google Calendar and want them in MyScheduly immediately, click this button to force a refresh.
*   **Disconnect:** If you need to switch accounts (e.g., from work email to personal email), use this button to safely remove the connection before adding the new one.
*   **Test Connection:** (Advanced) If you think updates aren't happening, use this to check if the "live link" is still active.

## Switching Providers

If you want to switch from Google to Outlook (or vice versa):
1.  **Disconnect First:** Click the "Disconnect" button on your current integration.
2.  **Wait a Moment:** The system will clean up the old connection.
3.  **Connect New:** Select the new provider and follow the setup steps.

**Note:** When you disconnect, appointments that were already synced will remain in MyScheduly, but they will stop updating if you change them in your old calendar.
