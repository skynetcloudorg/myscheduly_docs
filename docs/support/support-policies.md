# Support Policies

## Priority Support for Subscribers
We prioritize support for active business customers to ensure their operations run smoothly.

### The "Registered Email" Rule
**You must send your email from the address linked to your active MyScheduly account.**

*   **Why?** This instantly verifies your identity and subscription status.
*   **Active Subscribers:** Requests from verified account emails are automatically routed to our **Priority Queue**.
*   **Non-Subscribers / Unknown Emails:** Emails from addresses we don't recognize (e.g., a personal Gmail not linked to your account) may be:
    *   Flagged by spam filters.
    *   Placed in a lower-priority queue.
    *   Delayed while we ask for proof of identity.

**Tip:** If you cannot access your registered email, please have a Team Owner or another Admin from your organization contact us on your behalf.

## Response Times
We are committed to rapid resolution for our partners.

*   **Priority Tickets:** We aim to respond within **24 hours** (Business Days).
*   **Standard Tickets:** Response times may vary based on volume.

## Scope of Support
**We Can Help With:**
*   System errors and bugs.
*   Questions about features and configuration.
*   Billing and subscription inquiries.
*   Account access issues.

**We Cannot Help With:**
*   Issues related to your own hardware or internet connection.
*   Third-party software not integrated with MyScheduly.
*   Custom coding or development outside our official API.
