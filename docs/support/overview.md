## Quick Action Checklist
If you are ready to email us now, remember: **The more information you provide in your first email, the faster we can fix your issue.**

"My calendar isn't working" requires us to ask "How?", which delays the fix. Please run through this checklist before you hit send to `support@myscheduly.com`:

### 1. Be Specific
Describe the exact steps you took.
*   **Bad:** "I can't book."
*   **Good:** "I went to the Checkout page, selected the 'Haircut' service for tomorrow at 10 AM, and clicked 'Confirm'. The button spun for 10 seconds and then showed a 'Network Error' popup."

### 2. Provide Identifiers
We can look up specific records if you give us the ID.
*   **Appointment ID:** (e.g., `#APT-12345`)
*   **Customer Name:** (e.g., "Jane Doe")
*   **Voucher Code:** (e.g., `SUMMER2024`)

### 3. Include Visuals
*   **Screenshots/Video:** A picture of the error message or a short video of the process is worth 1000 words.

### 4. Send!
Address your email to: `support@myscheduly.com`
*   **Important:** Send from your **Registered Account Email** to get priority service.
*   **Template:** [Click here to see the recommended email template](./contacting-support.md#email-template).
