# Effective Reporting

## How to Get a Fast Resolution
The more information you provide in your first email, the faster we can fix your issue. "My calendar isn't working" requires us to ask "How?", which delays the fix.

Here is a checklist to run through before you hit send.

## 1. Be Specific
Describe the exact steps you took.
*   **Bad:** "I can't book."
*   **Good:** "I went to the Checkout page, selected the 'Haircut' service for tomorrow at 10 AM, and clicked 'Confirm'. The button spun for 10 seconds and then showed a 'Network Error' popup."

## 2. Provide Context
*   **Where:** Tell us the exact page URL or menu name.
*   **Who:** Is this happening to you, a specific staff member, or a client?
*   **When:** Did this start today? Has it happened before?

## 3. Include Identifiers
We can look up specific records if you give us the ID.
*   **Appointment ID:** (e.g., `#APT-12345`)
*   **Customer Name:** (e.g., "Jane Doe")
*   **Voucher Code:** (e.g., `SUMMER2024`)

## 4. A Picture is Worth 1000 Words
*   **Screenshots:** Capture the entire screen if possible, so we can see the browser and URL.
*   **Screen Recordings:** If the issue is a complex flow (like drag-and-drop not working), a 10-second video is incredibly helpful.

## 5. Check the Documentation First
