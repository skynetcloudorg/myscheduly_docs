# Customers — Troubleshooting

Version: 1.0.29 | Last updated: 2025-11-27

## Common Issues and Solutions

### I can’t find a customer
- Check spelling in search by name, email, or phone.
- Clear status filters that might be hiding results.

### Reminder messages aren’t going out
- Verify the customer’s email/phone is correct.
- Confirm the appointment’s status is Confirmed; reminders do not send for Pending or Customer Confirmed.
- Check your team’s email/SMS settings are active.

### Preferences aren’t visible to staff
- Add notes under the customer’s profile and keep them updated.
- Ask staff to review notes before each appointment.

### I need to block a customer
- Open the profile, set “Blocked” to on, and add a reason.
- Blocking does not automatically cancel existing appointments; follow your team policy for new bookings.
- Unblock when appropriate and include an unblocking note.

## Tips
- Use consistent tags/notes across your team to make searching easier.
- Keep sensitive information minimal and respectful.
- Review profiles regularly to keep data clean and useful.

## Validation Checklist
- Create a test customer and book a Confirmed appointment to confirm reminders.
- Edit the profile and verify changes appear for staff.
- Test blocking/unblocking and confirm booking behavior matches your policy.
