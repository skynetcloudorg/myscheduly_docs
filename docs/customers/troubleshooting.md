# Troubleshooting

Common questions and solutions when managing your customer database.

## "I can't find a customer I know exists."

**Check Your Search Terms**
*   Are you searching by the right field? Try searching by **phone number** instead of name (names can be misspelled).
*   Check for typos. "Jon" vs "John".

**Check Filters**
*   Do you have a filter applied (e.g., "Blocked Only")? Clear all filters to see the full list.

## "The customer isn't receiving emails."

**Check Verification Status**
*   Look at the **Identity & Verification** card. Is their status `Pending`?
*   **Fix:** Ask them to check their Spam/Junk folder for the verification email. Until verified, some providers might block our messages.

**Check for Typos**
*   It happens often: `name@gamil.com` instead of `gmail.com`.
*   **Fix:** Edit the profile and correct the email address.

## "I blocked a customer, but they still have an appointment."

**Blocking Stops *New* Bookings Only**
*   Blocking a customer prevents them from creating *future* bookings.
*   It does **not** automatically cancel appointments that are already on the calendar.
*   **Fix:** You must manually cancel any existing future appointments if you no longer wish to serve them.

## "Why is this customer's Trust Score low?"

**Look for Red Flags**
*   Did they just sign up with a disposable email address?
*   Do they have a history of cancelled appointments?
*   **Action:** A low score doesn't mean you *must* block them, but you should be careful. Consider calling them to confirm their first booking.
