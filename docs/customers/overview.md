# Customer Management

Your customers are the heart of your business. The Customer Management module in MyScheduly is designed to help you build stronger relationships, not just store phone numbers.

## Why This Matters

A well-maintained customer database allows you to:
*   **Personalize the Experience:** Know exactly what your client likes (and dislikes) before they walk in the door.
*   **Save Time:** Stop asking for contact details every time.
*   **Reduce Risks:** Identify reliable clients vs. potential no-shows using Trust Scores.
*   **Market Smarter:** See who your VIPs are and who hasn't visited in a while.

## What's in This Section

We have broken down the guide to help you master your client data:

*   **[Managing Customers](./managing-customers):** The basics of adding, searching, editing, and blocking client records.
*   **[Understanding Profiles](./customer-profiles):** A deep dive into the "Trust Score," verification status, and how to use internal notes effectively.
*   **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting):** Solutions for common issues like missing profiles or email delivery problems.

## Key Features
*   **Automatic Profile Creation:** When a new client books online, we create a profile for you automatically.
*   **Trust & Security:** An automatic score (0-100) that helps you assess client reliability.
*   **History Tracking:** See every past appointment, payment, and note in one timeline.

Start by learning how to **[add and manage your customers](./managing-customers)**.
