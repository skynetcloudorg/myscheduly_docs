# Managing Customers

Building a clean and organized customer database is the foundation of good service. This guide explains how to add, update, and organize your client records in MyScheduly.

## Adding a New Customer

You can add a customer manually at any time, even before they make their first booking.

1.  **Navigate to Customers:** Click the **Customers** tab in your main dashboard.
2.  **Click "New Customer":** This opens the creation form.
3.  **Fill in Essential Details:**
    *   **Name:** Use the name they prefer to be called.
    *   **Email:** Crucial for sending booking confirmations and receipts.
    *   **Phone:** Required if you want to send SMS reminders.
4.  **Save:** The profile is created instantly and ready for booking.

**Note:** If a customer books online by themselves, a profile is automatically created for them. You don't need to double-enter their data.

## Searching and Filtering

As your list grows, finding the right person quickly becomes important.

*   **Search Bar:** Type a name, email address, or phone number. The system searches partial matches (e.g., "555" will find phone numbers containing 555).
*   **Sorting:** Click the column headers to sort by **Total Spent**, **Last Visit**, or **Created Date**. This is great for finding your VIPs or your newest sign-ups.

## Editing and Updating

People move, get new numbers, or change their names. Keeping records current ensures your messages reach them.

1.  Open the customer's profile.
2.  Click the **Edit** button.
3.  Update the necessary fields.
4.  **Save Changes.**

**Impact of Changes:**
*   Future appointment reminders will go to the *new* email/phone.
*   Past receipts and history remain unchanged.

## Blocking a Customer

Sometimes, you may need to prevent a specific client from making future bookings (e.g., repeated no-shows or inappropriate behavior).

1.  Open the customer's profile.
2.  Click **Edit**.
3.  Toggle the **Status** to **Blocked**.
4.  **Add a Reason:** Write a brief internal note explaining why (e.g., "3 consecutive no-shows"). This note is visible only to your staff, not the client.

**What happens when blocked?**
*   The customer cannot book new appointments online.
*   Existing appointments are *not* automatically cancelled (you must do this manually if needed).
*   You can still manually book them in the dashboard if you choose to override the block.
