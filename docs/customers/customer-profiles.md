# Understanding Customer Profiles

A customer profile in MyScheduly is more than just a contact card. It contains powerful insights to help you deliver personalized service and assess client reliability.

## The Profile Cards

When you open a customer's record, you will see several distinct sections. Here is what they tell you.

### 1. Identity & Verification
This section confirms if the person is who they say they are.
*   **Verification Status:** Shows if they have clicked the "Verify Email" link sent during signup.
    *   `Verified`: Good! Messages are reaching them.
    *   `Pending`: They haven't verified yet. Remind them to check their inbox so they don't miss appointment updates.

### 2. Trust & Security Score
MyScheduly calculates a "Trust Score" (0-100) to help you spot potential risks.
*   **Green (High Score):** Reliable client. Verified email, successful payment history.
*   **Red (Low Score):** Caution needed. Might have a history of failed payments, high cancellation rates, or uses a disposable email address.
*   **Usage:** Use this score when deciding whether to approve a high-value booking request.

### 3. Profile Notes
This is your internal "cheat sheet" for delivering great service.
*   **What to write:** Allergies, coffee preferences, hair texture, or specific requests (e.g., "Prefers quiet appointments").
*   **Privacy:** These notes are strictly internal. The customer never sees them.

### 4. Appointment History
A complete timeline of their relationship with your business.
*   **Past Visits:** See exactly what they booked before to easily replicate a previous service.
*   **No-Shows:** Quickly spot if a client has a habit of missing appointments.
*   **Total Value:** See the lifetime revenue generated by this client.

## Why It Matters
Using the full profile allows you to:
*   **Personalize:** "Hi Sarah, do you want the same hair treatment as last time?"
*   **Protect:** "I see this client has a low Trust Score; let's require a deposit."
*   **Connect:** "It's been 6 months since your last visit, time to book?"
