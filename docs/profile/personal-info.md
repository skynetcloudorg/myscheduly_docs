# Personal Information

## Why This Matters
Your profile information is your identity within MyScheduly. It's how your team members recognize you and how clients see you on the booking page (if your profile is public). Keeping this accurate ensures smooth communication and professional presentation.

## Managing Your Details

### Updating Name and Photo
Your display name and photo appear in your team's schedule, appointment logs, and potentially to clients.

1.  **Navigate to Profile:** Click your avatar in the top right corner and select **Profile**.
2.  **Edit Name:** Type your preferred name in the "Name" field.
3.  **Update Photo:**
    *   Click **Upload Photo** to choose a new image file (JPG or PNG recommended).
    *   You'll see a live preview of how it looks.
    *   Click **Save** to apply the change.
    *   To revert to the default initial avatar, click **Remove Photo**.

**Best Practice:** Use a clear, professional headshot and your real first and last name so clients feel comfortable booking with you.

### Changing Your Email
Your email address is your primary login identifier and the destination for system notifications.

1.  **Enter New Email:** In the "Email" field, type your new address.
2.  **Save:** Click the **Save** button.
3.  **Verify:** MyScheduly will send a verification link to the *new* email address.

**What Happens Next:**
*   **Immediate:** You can continue to log in with your old credentials until the change is fully processed.
*   **Pending:** The new email is in a "pending" state until you click the verification link.
*   **Final:** Once verified, your login username changes to the new email, and all future notifications will be sent there.

## Troubleshooting
*   **I didn't receive the verification email:** Check your Spam/Junk folder. If it's not there, try changing the email again to trigger a new email.
*   **Photo won't upload:** Ensure the file size is under 5MB and is a standard image format (JPG, PNG).
