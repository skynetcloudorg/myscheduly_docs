# Authentication Methods

## Why This Matters
MyScheduly supports flexible sign-in options. You can use a traditional email/password or link your account to a Google or Microsoft account for faster, one-click access (Single Sign-On or SSO).

## Using Single Sign-On (SSO)

### Linking an Account
If you have an existing MyScheduly account and want to sign in with Google or Microsoft:

1.  **Go to Profile:** Find the **Linked Accounts** section.
2.  **Choose Provider:** Click **Link Google** or **Link Microsoft**.
3.  **Authorize:** You will be redirected to the provider's login page. Grant permission to MyScheduly.
4.  **Done:** You can now use the "Continue with..." buttons on the login screen.

**Note:** You can only link *one* SSO provider at a time.

### Unlinking an Account
If you want to stop using Google/Microsoft login:

1.  **Set a Password First:** **Important!** If you created your account via SSO, you might not have a MyScheduly password yet. Set one in the Password section first so you don't lock yourself out.
2.  **Unlink:** Click the **Unlink** button next to the provider.
3.  **Confirm:** Your account is now standalone. You must use email and password to log in.

## Switching Providers
To switch from Google to Microsoft (or vice versa):
1.  Unlink the current provider.
2.  Link the new provider.
*You cannot have both linked simultaneously.*

## Best Practices
*   **Security:** Ensure your Google or Microsoft account is secured with 2FA, as it becomes a master key to your MyScheduly account.
*   **Work vs. Personal:** Be careful linking a personal Gmail to a work account if you might lose access to that email later.
