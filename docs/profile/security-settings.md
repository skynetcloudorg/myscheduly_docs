# Security Settings

## Why This Matters
Your account contains sensitive business and client data. Protecting it with a strong password and additional security layers like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is essential to prevent unauthorized access.

## Password Management

### Changing Your Password
You should change your password periodically or if you suspect your account has been compromised.

1.  **Go to Profile:** Navigate to the **Security** section (or scroll down on the main Profile page).
2.  **Enter Current Password:** For security, you must prove it's you before making changes.
3.  **Create New Password:** Enter a strong, unique password.
4.  **Confirm:** Type it again to ensure no typos.
5.  **Save:** Click **Update Password**.

**What Happens:**
*   Your password changes immediately.
*   You stay logged in on your *current* device.
*   It is highly recommended to log out other sessions after a password change (see below).

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
2FA adds a second lock to your door. Even if someone steals your password, they can't log in without your phone.

### Enabling 2FA
1.  **Toggle On:** Find the **Two-Factor Authentication** setting and switch it to ON.
2.  **Scan QR Code:** Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) on your phone to scan the code displayed on screen.
3.  **Verify:** Enter the 6-digit code your app generates to confirm the link.
4.  **Save Recovery Codes:** **Crucial Step!** Copy the recovery codes displayed and save them in a secure place (like a password manager). These are your only way back in if you lose your phone.

### Disabling 2FA
If you need to turn it off (e.g., switching phones):
1.  Toggle the setting to OFF.
2.  Confirm with your password.
3.  Your account reverts to password-only protection.

## Browser Sessions
This feature shows you everywhere your account is currently logged in.

### Managing Sessions
1.  **View Sessions:** Look at the **Browser Sessions** list. It shows device type (e.g., Chrome on Windows) and last active time.
2.  **Log Out Others:** If you see a device you don't recognize or want to ensure you're logged out of an old computer, click **Log Out Other Browser Sessions**.

**Result:**
*   All other devices are immediately disconnected.
*   Anyone trying to use those sessions will be forced to log in again.
*   Your current session remains active.
