# Profile

Your Profile is where you keep your account accurate and secure. Here you update your name, email, and photo, choose how you sign in, and control the devices that are allowed to stay logged in. Each change has a clear, practical effect on how you and your team experience MyScheduly.

## Profile Information
When you update your name or photo and save, these changes appear across the app immediately. This helps teammates and clients recognize you in lists, messages, and appointment records. If you update your email, MyScheduly sends a new verification link. Your login continues to work, but some email‑based features wait until the new address is verified, so it’s best to confirm right away.

How to use:
- Edit your name and email and click Save.
- Upload a new photo; you’ll see a live preview. Click Save to apply.
- Use Remove Photo if you prefer the default avatar.

Example:
You change your display name and upload a clearer headshot. Your teammates and clients immediately see the new name and photo in schedules and public page, making it easier to identify your updates and availability.

Best practices:
- Use a professional name and a bright, centered photo.
- Verify your new email promptly to keep notifications flowing.

## Password
Your password protects your account. When you save a new password, it takes effect immediately. If you think another device still has access, log out your other sessions to ensure only your current device remains signed in.

How to use:
- Enter your current password, then choose and confirm a new one. Click Save.
- If needed, log out other sessions to secure your account.

Example:
After noticing unusual activity, you change your password and log out other sessions. Your account is now protected, and all other devices must sign in again.

Best practices:
- Choose a long, unique password and store it in a password manager.
- Update periodically, especially after suspicious activity.

## SSO Account Linking
Single sign‑on lets you use Google or Microsoft to sign in. Linking a provider means you can log in with that provider’s button. Only one provider can be linked at a time. Before unlinking, set a password; this prevents lockout and ensures you can still sign in.

How to use:
- Link Google or Microsoft from Profile.
- To switch providers, unlink the current one first, then link the new one.

Example:
You link your Google account and start signing in with “Continue with Google”. Later, you decide to unlink Google. You first set a password, then unlink safely, and continue signing in with your email and password.

Best practices:
- Keep your Google/Microsoft account secure (enable 2FA with your provider).
- Always set a password before unlinking SSO.

## Two‑Factor Authentication (2FA)
Two‑factor adds a one‑time code on top of your password for stronger protection. After enabling, you’ll enter codes from an authenticator app when you sign in. Recovery codes act as a backup if you lose your device.

How to use:
- Enable 2FA, scan the QR code with your authenticator app, and confirm with a code.
- Store recovery codes in a safe place. You can show or regenerate them later.
- Disable if necessary, understanding you’ll return to password‑only sign‑in.

Example:
You enable 2FA and save your recovery codes in a password manager. On your next login, you enter your password and a code from your app, keeping your account safer against unauthorized access.

Best practices:
- Test a sign‑in after enabling to confirm everything works.
- Never share recovery codes; treat them like master keys.

## Browser Sessions
Browser Sessions show where your account is currently signed in. Logging out other sessions ends access on those devices while keeping you signed in here. This is a quick way to secure your account after a password change or if you used a shared computer.

How to use:
- Open Browser Sessions and select “Log Out Other Browser Sessions”. Confirm with your password.

Example:
You logged in on a public computer earlier. From your phone, you log out other sessions. That computer can no longer access your account.

Best practices:
- Use this after changing your password or whenever you suspect unauthorized access.

## Delete Account
Deleting your account permanently removes your access and starts data cleanup. Use this only when you are sure you no longer need MyScheduly. You’ll confirm with your password.

How to use:
- Click Delete Account and follow the confirmation steps. Download any data you want to keep first.

Example:
You’re consolidating services and decide to close your account. You export needed information, confirm deletion, and your access ends immediately.

Best practices:
- Consider whether you just need to change teams or settings instead.
- Remember that deletion is final.

## Quick Checklist
- Is your new email verified so notifications arrive correctly?
- Did you set a strong, unique password?
- Is 2FA enabled and are recovery codes stored safely?
- Do you recognize all active browser sessions?
- If using SSO, did you link only one provider and set a password before unlinking?
