# Profile — Overview

## Why This Matters
Your Profile is the command center for your personal identity and account security within MyScheduly. It’s where you control how you appear to others, how you sign in, and how you protect your account from unauthorized access.

Keeping this section up-to-date ensures you receive important notifications and that your account remains secure.

## In This Section

### [Personal Information](./personal-info.md)
Manage your public face. Learn how to update your display name, profile photo, and change your login email address.

### [Security Settings](./security-settings.md)
Protect your account. Set a strong password, enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and remotely log out of other devices if you suspect unauthorized access.

### [Authentication Methods](./authentication-methods.md)
Simplify your login. Learn how to link your Google or Microsoft account for single sign-on (SSO) access.

### [Account Management](./account-management.md)
Understand the "Danger Zone." Learn the irreversible process of permanently deleting your account and what to do before you take that step.

## Quick Checklist
