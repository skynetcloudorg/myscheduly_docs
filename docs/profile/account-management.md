# Account Management

## Why This Matters
You have full control over your account lifecycle. Whether you are leaving the platform or just need a fresh start, it's important to understand how to permanently delete your data.

## Deleting Your Account

### Before You Delete
**Warning:** Account deletion is **permanent** and cannot be undone.
*   **Export Data:** If you need appointment history or client lists, export them from the relevant sections (Customers, Dashboard) before proceeding.
*   **Check Subscriptions:** Ensure you have cancelled any active paid plans to prevent future billing (though deletion usually stops this, it's a safe double-check).

### The Deletion Process
1.  **Navigate to Profile:** Scroll to the very bottom of the page to the **Danger Zone**.
2.  **Click Delete Account:** A confirmation modal will appear.
3.  **Verify Identity:** You will be asked to enter your password to confirm you really want to do this.
4.  **Confirm:** Click the final **Delete** button.

**What Happens Next:**
*   **Immediate Lockout:** You are logged out immediately.
*   **Data Cleanup:** Your personal data is queued for deletion from our servers.
*   **Irreversible:** Support cannot restore your account once this process begins.

## Alternatives to Deletion
*   **Changing Teams:** If you just want to join a different organization, ask the new admin to invite your current email. You don't need to delete your account.
*   **Updating Email:** If you changed jobs, update your email address in **Personal Information** instead of creating a new account.
