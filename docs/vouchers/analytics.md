# Reporting & Analytics

Tracking the performance of your vouchers is essential to understanding your Return on Investment (ROI). The reporting tools help you see which promotions are working and how much revenue is coming from prepaid gift cards.

## Key Metrics to Watch

In your dashboard, you can access specific reports for vouchers and gift cards. Here is what the data tells you:

*   **Usage Count:** How many times a specific code has been redeemed. High usage indicates a popular promotion.
*   **Total Discounted:** The total value of revenue you "gave away" as discounts. Compare this against the extra bookings you gained to measure success.
*   **Revenue Impact:** See how much actual revenue (post-discount) was generated by bookings that used a voucher.

## Tracking Gift Cards vs. Discounts

It is important to distinguish between these two for your accounting:

### Discount Vouchers
These are treated as a **reduction in revenue**. When a client uses a 10% off coupon, the sale is recorded at 90% of the value. The 10% is not money "lost," but rather money not collected.

### Gift Cards
Gift cards are treated as **prepaid liability**.
1.  **When Sold:** When you sell a gift card, you collect cash, but you haven't performed a service yet. This is often tracked as "Deferred Revenue" or "Gift Card Liability."
2.  **When Redeemed:** When a client uses the gift card, the liability decreases, and the revenue is recognized for the service provided.

## Using Insights for Future Campaigns

Use the data to refine your strategy:
*   **Low Usage?** Maybe the discount wasn't attractive enough, or the "Minimum Order Value" was too high. Try lowering the threshold next time.
*   **High Usage but Low Revenue?** If a discount is too popular but your margins are suffering, consider adding a "Per-User Limit" or lowering the discount percentage.
*   **Gift Card Trends:** Watch for seasonal spikes (like holidays). This helps you plan marketing pushes for gift card sales during peak gifting seasons.
