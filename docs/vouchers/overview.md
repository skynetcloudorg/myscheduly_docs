# Vouchers & Gift Cards

Welcome to the Vouchers and Gift Cards guide. This module is designed to help you grow your business by offering flexible promotions and prepaid credit options.

## Why Use Vouchers?

In a competitive market, giving your customers a reason to book now is crucial. The Vouchers system allows you to:
*   **Run Promotions:** Create urgency with limited-time offers (e.g., "Summer Sale").
*   **Reward Loyalty:** Give special codes to your best clients to keep them coming back.
*   **Sell Gift Cards:** Allow clients to buy credit for themselves or friends, securing revenue for you upfront.
*   **Handle Service Recovery:** Offer store credit instead of cash refunds if a client is unhappy, keeping the money in your business.

## How It Works

The system handles two main types of codes:

1.  **Promotional Codes (Vouchers):** These give a discount (fixed amount or percentage) on a booking. They are typically used for marketing campaigns.
2.  **Gift Cards:** These are prepaid value. Clients buy them (or you issue them) and they hold a balance that can be spent over time.
