# Vouchers & Gift Cards

Use vouchers to offer discounts and gift cards to sell prepaid credit. This drives new bookings, rewards loyalty, and helps with promotions and refunds. Available on all plans.

## When To Use
- Run a promotion (percentage or fixed discount).
- Encourage repeat visits (single-use codes with per‑user limits).
- Sell gift cards (prepaid balance clients can spend over time).
- Offer goodwill or partial refunds as store credit.

## How It Works
- Clients enter a code during checkout; valid codes apply a discount immediately.
- Discounts can be fixed (e.g., $10 off) or percentage (e.g., 15%). Percentage discounts cannot exceed 100%.
- Gift cards deduct from the card’s balance up to the order amount; any remaining balance stays for future visits.
- If the cart has multiple services, the discount is spread proportionally across items.
- Codes must belong to your team and follow rules like expiry date, maximum usage, per‑user limit, and minimum order value. These rules apply to all voucher types.
- Inactive or expired codes will not apply.
- The system prevents simultaneous use of the same code from multiple sessions to avoid double‑spending.

## Create A Voucher
- Open Voucher Management and create a new voucher.
- Choose Type:
  - Fixed discount: subtracts a set amount.
  - Percentage discount: subtracts a percentage (1–100%).
  - Gift card: creates prepaid balance that can be used across visits.
- Set Amount:
  - Fixed amount in your currency; percentage between 1–100.
  - For gift cards, amount becomes initial and current balance.
- Optional Rules:
  - Expiration date: code stops working after this date.
  - Maximum usage: total times the code can be used (not used for gift cards; gift cards rely on balance).
  - Per‑user limit: times a single customer can redeem the code.
  - Minimum order value: order must be at least this amount.
- Generate or enter a code, then mark Active.
- Save.

## Manage Vouchers
- Edit fields to adjust the promotion going forward.
- Deactivate to stop further use; existing bookings stay unchanged.
- For gift cards, balance decreases each time they are used; when balance reaches zero, the card can no longer be applied.
- Avoid deleting vouchers that have usage history; deactivate instead to keep your records complete.

## Applying A Voucher (Client Experience)
- Clients add services and enter the code at checkout.
- If valid, the discount appears immediately:
  - Fixed/percentage: total decreases and each item shows its share of the discount.
  - Gift card: the system uses the available balance and shows what was deducted; any remainder stays for next time.
- Clients complete booking with the reduced total.

## Behavior Of Settings
- Changing Type recalculates how the amount is interpreted (percentage vs fixed vs gift card balance).
- Editing Amount changes the future discount or gift card balance at creation time; existing gift cards keep their current balance unless specifically adjusted.
- Updating Expiration, Usage, Per‑user limit, or Minimum order value affects future attempts to use the code. Past bookings are not modified.
- Setting Active OFF blocks any new use immediately.

## Tips Or Common Mistakes
- Keep codes simple and uppercase to avoid typos.
- Set a clear expiry and usage limits for promotions.
- Use per‑user limits to prevent one customer from reusing a promo.
- Add a minimum order value to avoid very small baskets.
- Deactivate promoted codes after campaigns end to prevent accidental use.
- Share updated terms with clients when you change voucher details.

## Reporting & Analytics
- Track gift card revenue and voucher performance in the dashboard.
- See top vouchers, recent activity, voucher type breakdown, ROI, and cost savings.
- Gift cards are counted as prepaid revenue at creation and as balance used over time; discount vouchers are counted as revenue reductions when applied.
- Use these insights to refine future campaigns.

## Quick Checklist
- Type and Amount set correctly?
- Expiry, max usage, and per‑user limits defined?
- Minimum order value set if needed?
- Code is Active and easy to share?
- Tested a code on a small cart before promoting?
- Communicated start/end dates and terms to clients?
