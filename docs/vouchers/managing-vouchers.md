# Managing Active Vouchers

Once your vouchers are live, you may need to adjust them or monitor their status. Managing your vouchers effectively ensures that your promotions run smoothly and that you can respond to changing business needs.

## Editing Existing Vouchers

You can modify most details of a voucher even after it has been created. However, it is important to understand how these changes affect your customers.

### changing the Voucher Type
If you change a voucher's type (for example, from a Fixed Discount to a Percentage), the system recalculates the value based on the new type. This can significantly change the discount amount, so be careful when editing active codes.

### Adjusting Limits and Expiry
You can extend a promotion by changing the **Expiration Date** or increase the **Maximum Usage** limit if a campaign is more popular than expected. These changes apply immediately to any future attempts to use the code.

**Note:** Changes to limits or values do *not* affect bookings that have already been completed. Past transactions remain unchanged.

## Deactivating vs. Deleting

When you want to stop a promotion, you have two options. Understanding the difference is key to maintaining accurate records.

### Deactivate (Recommended)
Turning the **Active** toggle to **OFF** immediately stops the code from working. Anyone trying to use it will see an error message saying the code is invalid.
*   **Why use this:** This preserves the history of the voucher. You can still see how many times it was used and the revenue it generated. You can also reactivate it later if you want to run the same promotion again.

### Delete
Deleting a voucher removes it from the system entirely.
*   **Warning:** You should avoid deleting vouchers that have been used. If you delete a voucher, you lose the link between the code and the historical bookings, which can mess up your reporting. Only delete vouchers that were created by mistake and never used.

## Managing Gift Card Balances

For **Gift Cards**, the "Amount" field represents the initial value.
*   If you edit the amount of a gift card template, it only affects *newly created* gift cards.
*   Existing gift cards retain their current remaining balance.
*   As customers use their gift cards, the balance automatically decreases. When it hits zero, the card can no longer be used.
