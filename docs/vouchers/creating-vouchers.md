# Creating Vouchers & Gift Cards

Creating effective promotional codes and gift cards is a powerful way to drive new bookings and reward your loyal customers. Whether you want to run a seasonal sale, offer store credit, or sell gift cards, the voucher system provides the flexibility to set up exactly what you need.

## Choosing the Right Voucher Type

Before you create a code, it is important to understand which type best fits your goal. You have three options, and each behaves differently for your customers:

*   **Fixed Discount:** This subtracts a specific currency amount from the total order (e.g., $10 off). It is great for clear, value-based promotions.
*   **Percentage Discount:** This removes a percentage of the total order value (e.g., 15% off). This is ideal for encouraging larger orders, as the discount grows with the cart size.
*   **Gift Card:** This creates a prepaid balance. Unlike discounts, gift cards act like cash. Customers can use them over multiple visits until the balance runs out.

## Setting Up Your Voucher

To get started, navigate to the **Voucher Management** section in your dashboard and click to create a new voucher.

### 1. Define the Value
First, you will set the **Amount**.
*   For **discounts**, this is the value deducted from the order.
*   For **gift cards**, this is the initial balance available to the customer.

### 2. Establish Usage Rules
Rules help you control how and when the voucher can be used, protecting your revenue while offering value.

*   **Expiration Date:** Set a date when the code will stop working. This creates urgency for your customers to book.
*   **Minimum Order Value:** You can require a minimum spend (e.g., "Save $10 on orders over $50"). This ensures that the discount does not eat up your entire margin on small bookings.
*   **Maximum Usage:** This limits the *total* number of times the code can be used by anyone. This is perfect for "First 50 people" campaigns. Note that this applies to the code itself, not the balance of a gift card.
*   **Per-User Limit:** This restricts how many times a *single* customer can use the code. Use this to prevent one person from using a "Welcome" discount multiple times.

### 3. Activate and Share
Once you have configured your settings, generate a unique code (or enter your own, like `SUMMER2024`) and mark it as **Active**.

**Important:** A voucher must be marked as Active to be accepted at checkout. If you are preparing a campaign for later, you can save it as inactive and switch it on when you are ready to launch.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you want to boost bookings for a slow month. You could create a **Percentage Discount** voucher for 20% off.
*   **Code:** `SPRING20`
*   **Expiration:** End of the month
*   **Per-User Limit:** 1 (so they book once)
*   **Minimum Order:** $30 (to ensure it's worth it)

When a customer uses this, they get a great deal, and you get a guaranteed booking above your minimum threshold.
