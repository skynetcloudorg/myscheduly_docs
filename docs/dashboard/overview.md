# Dashboard Overview

Welcome to your command center. The Dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in, designed to give you an immediate pulse on your business health.

## Why Use the Dashboard?

Running a business involves tracking a lot of moving parts. The dashboard brings them all together so you can answer critical questions in seconds:
*   **"How much money did we make today?"** (Financial Health)
*   **"Are we busy next week?"** (Operational Planning)
*   **"Is our new promotion working?"** (Marketing Performance)
*   **"Which staff member is retaining the most clients?"** (Team Management)

## What You Will Find Here

We have broken down the dashboard guide into focused sections to help you master your data:

*   **[Navigating the Dashboard](./navigating-the-dashboard):** Learn how to use filters, switch views, and understand the layout. Start here if you are new.
*   **[Key Metrics Explained](./key-metrics):** A plain-English guide to every number on the screen (Revenue, AOV, Churn, etc.) and why it matters.
*   **[Analyzing Performance](./analyzing-performance):** How to read the charts and tables to spot trends and make smarter decisions.
*   **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting):** Quick fixes if the numbers don't look right or you can't see certain data.

## Who Is It For?
*   **Business Owners:** See the big picture—revenue, growth, and customer retention.
*   **Managers:** Track team performance and daily schedules.
*   **Staff:** View personal schedules and individual performance metrics (depending on permissions).

Start by learning how to **[navigate the interface](./navigating-the-dashboard)**.
