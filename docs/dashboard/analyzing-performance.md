# Analyzing Performance

Beyond simple numbers, the dashboard offers visual tools to help you spot trends and make strategic decisions. This section explains how to read the charts and tables to uncover deeper insights.

## Revenue Trends Chart

This line chart visualizes your financial performance over time.
*   **The Line:** Shows your revenue for each day (or month).
*   **The Trend:** Look for the general direction. Is it moving up, staying flat, or dipping?
*   **Comparison:** Use the "Previous Period" comparison to see if you are doing better than last month or last year.

**Pro Tip:** Spikes often correspond to weekends or promotional campaigns. Valleys might indicate slow days (like Mondays) where you could run a special offer.

## Service Performance Table

This table breaks down your revenue by service type. It answers the question: *"What are my best sellers?"*
*   **Rank:** Services are ordered by revenue generated.
*   **Share:** Shows what percentage of your total income comes from this specific service.

**Decision Making:**
*   **Top Performers:** These are your "bread and butter." Make sure you always have staff available to perform them.
*   **Underperformers:** If a service has very low bookings, consider removing it, changing the price, or rebranding it to make it more attractive.

## Voucher Analytics

If you run promotions, this section is crucial for measuring ROI (Return on Investment).

*   **Usage Count:** How many times was a code used? High usage means the offer is attractive.
*   **Total Discounted:** How much revenue did you "give away"?
*   **Revenue Impact:** How much *actual* revenue did those discounted bookings bring in?

**Strategy Check:**
If you gave away $100 in discounts but generated $1,000 in revenue, your promotion is a success! If you gave away $500 to get $600, your discount might be too aggressive.

## Today's Schedule

A tactical view for daily operations.
*   **Status Tags:** Quickly see which appointments are `Confirmed`, `Pending`, or `Completed`.
*   **Action:** Use this list to prepare for the day. Check for any unconfirmed appointments and follow up with those clients to prevent no-shows.
