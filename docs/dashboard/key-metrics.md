# Key Metrics Explained

Numbers tell a story. The dashboard presents several key indicators (KPIs) to help you understand the health of your business. Here is how to interpret them and what they mean for your growth.

## Financial Health

### Total Revenue
**What it is:** The total earnings from completed appointments during the selected period.
*   **Why it matters:** This is your top-line growth.
*   **Action:** If this is dipping, look at your *Appointments Today* or *Conversion Rate* to find the cause.

### Average Order Value (AOV)
**What it is:** The average amount a client spends per visit.
*   **Why it matters:** Increasing AOV is often easier than finding new customers.
*   **Action:** If low, try offering add-ons or bundling services to encourage higher spending per visit.

### Gift Card Revenue
**What it is:** Money collected from selling gift cards.
*   **Why it matters:** This represents immediate cash flow, even if the service happens later.
*   **Note:** This is tracked when the card is *sold*, not when it is used.

## Customer Growth

### Active Customers
**What it is:** The number of unique clients who had a booking in this period.
*   **Why it matters:** Shows if your client base is active and engaged.

### New Customers
**What it is:** Clients who had their *first* appointment during this period.
*   **Why it matters:** Critical for long-term growth.
*   **Action:** If this number is high, your marketing is working! Make sure you have a retention strategy to keep them coming back.

## Operational Efficiency

### Completion Rate
**What it is:** The percentage of booked appointments that were successfully completed (not cancelled or no-shows).
*   **Why it matters:** A low rate (below 85%) suggests problems with cancellations.
*   **Action:** Review your reminder emails or cancellation policy if this number drops.

### Conversion Rate
**What it is:** The percentage of people who start the booking process and actually finish it.
*   **Why it matters:** Tells you how effective your booking page is.
*   **Action:** If this is low (e.g., below 20%), your booking process might be too complicated or your pricing unclear.

### Appointments Today
**What it is:** The count of bookings scheduled for the current day.
*   **Why it matters:** Helps you plan your daily staffing and resource needs.

## Customer Satisfaction

### Satisfaction Score
**What it is:** The average rating (out of 5) left by clients after their appointments.
*   **Why it matters:** High satisfaction leads to referrals and repeat business.
*   **Action:** Aim for 4.5 or higher. Read recent comments to address any specific complaints.
