## Tips for Consistent Reading
- Always check the selected period before comparing numbers.
- Combine metrics (e.g., AOV + Active Customers) to understand both value and volume.
- Use filters to isolate services or staff when diagnosing changes.

## Behavior Details
- Revenue Trends switch between daily and monthly points based on the period. Up to 31 days shows daily points; longer ranges show monthly points for clarity.
- Comparison labels are automatic (e.g., “Previous 30 Days (31–60 days ago)” for Last 30 Days) so you can immediately see what’s being compared.
- Gift cards: appointment totals power revenue and AOV. Gift card sales are counted at the moment of sale and may appear in revenue trend lines to reflect cash inflow.

### Voucher Analytics Formulas
- ROI: `(Revenue Generated – Total Discount Given) ÷ Total Discount Given × 100` — shows how effectively discounts drive sales.
- Revenue Generated: measured from voucher redemptions; when direct amounts are unavailable, the system estimates based on recent usage to keep ROI informative.

### Example
You run a New Year gift card push:
- Gift Card Revenue spikes on the sales days; the revenue trend may show a lift because prepaid cash is captured at sale.
- Voucher Analytics shows ROI at 42% and steady usage over two weeks; plan a follow‑up promo with similar timing.
- AOV rises when add‑ons are bundled; keep add‑on prompts visible on the booking page.
