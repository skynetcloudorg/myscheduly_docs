# Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard is your command center. It provides a real-time view of your business performance, from daily schedules to long-term revenue trends. This guide will help you find your way around and customize the view to get the answers you need.

## The Layout

The dashboard is organized to give you both a quick snapshot and deep insights:

*   **Top Bar (Filters):** Controls the data you see across the entire page.
*   **Metric Cards:** The top row shows "at a glance" numbers like Total Revenue, Appointments, and Active Customers.
*   **Interactive Charts:** Visual graphs that show trends over time.
*   **Detailed Tables:** Lists for Service Performance and Today's Schedule.

## Using Filters

Filters are powerful tools that let you slice and dice your data. When you change a filter, remember to click the **Refresh** button to update the screen.

### 1. Date Range
Choose the period you want to analyze.
*   **Today:** Perfect for checking the daily schedule and immediate performance.
*   **Last 30 Days:** Great for spotting monthly trends.
*   **Custom Range:** Select specific start and end dates for custom reporting.

**Note on Charts:** If you select a short range (up to 31 days), charts show *daily* data points. For longer ranges (like "This Year"), charts automatically switch to *monthly* data points to keep the view clean.

### 2. Service Filter
Want to know how just your "Massage" or "Haircut" services are doing? Select a specific service to filter all revenue and appointment data. This helps you identify which services are driving growth.

### 3. Staff Filter
Managers can select individual staff members to see their specific performance contribution.
*   **Staff View:** If you log in as a staff member (non-manager), you will automatically see a focused version of the dashboard showing only your own appointments and performance.

## Understanding Comparisons

Context is key. Knowing you made $1,000 is good, but knowing you made $1,000 *more than last month* is better.

*   **Automatic Comparison:** The dashboard automatically compares your selected period with the previous equivalent period.
*   **Example:** If you select "Last 30 Days," the system compares it against the *previous* 30 days (days 31-60 ago).
*   **Visual Indicators:** Look for green (growth) or red (decline) percentage indicators next to the big numbers.

## Timezones and "Today"

Your business runs on your local time.
*   **Team Timezone:** All data, including "Today's Schedule" and revenue reports, is based on the **Team Timezone** setting in your General Settings.
*   **Travel Friendly:** Even if you check the dashboard while traveling in a different timezone, the data remains consistent with your business location.

## Best Practices
*   **Refresh Often:** The dashboard does not auto-refresh every second. Hit the Refresh button after changing filters to ensure you are looking at the latest data.
*   **Check Permissions:** If you don't see financial data (revenue, AOV), it might be because your user role restricts access to sensitive financial information.
