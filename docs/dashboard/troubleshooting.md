# Troubleshooting

If the data on your dashboard doesn't look right, check these common issues before contacting support.

## "The numbers don't match my manual records."

**Check the Date Range**
*   It sounds simple, but it is the most common cause. Ensure you haven't accidentally selected "Last 7 Days" instead of "This Week".
*   Check the **Timezone**. If your manual records are in one timezone and the system is in another, the "end of the day" cutoff will be different, shifting bookings to the next day.

**Check the Filters**
*   Do you have a specific **Staff member** selected? This hides bookings for everyone else.
*   Do you have a **Service** filter applied?

## "I can't see revenue or financial charts."

**Check your Permissions**
*   For privacy and security, not all staff members have access to financial data.
*   If you are a staff member, you might only see your own schedule and performance stats. Ask your manager to check your "Role Permissions" if you need access.

## "The chart looks flat or empty."

**Check for Data**
*   If you selected a period with no bookings (like a future date range), the charts will be empty.
*   Click **Refresh**. The dashboard does not update live; it needs a refresh to pull in the latest bookings made in the last few minutes.

## "Gift Card revenue isn't showing up in the total."

**Understand the Calculation**
*   **Total Revenue** typically tracks *completed appointments*.
*   **Gift Card Revenue** is tracked separately when the card is *sold*.
*   Check the specific "Gift Card Revenue" card to see those sales. They might not be merged into the main "Service Revenue" line depending on your specific report view.
