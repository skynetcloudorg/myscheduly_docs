# Dashboard — Troubleshooting

Last updated: 2025-11-27

## Common Issues

### Data doesn’t change after applying filters
- Click Refresh to trigger an update.
- Confirm the selected date range actually includes appointments.
- Note that gift card revenue uses gift card creation date.

### Charts show “No Data”
- If there are no appointments or vouchers in the range, charts may show zeros.
- Try a broader period like Last 30 Days or This Year.

### Staff can’t access the dashboard
- Staff accounts see a simplified staff dashboard.
- Managers/Owners see the full dashboard. If access is restricted, ask your team admin to review your role and permissions.

### Financial cards are missing
- Some financial metrics require specific permissions. If you’re a staff member, your view may exclude revenue totals and advanced analytics.

### Numbers look off with gift cards
- Total Revenue counts completed appointments totals.
- AOV and Add-ons Revenue adjust for gift card and discount scenarios.
- Gift Card Revenue reflects sales when gift cards are created.

## Tips & Tricks
- Use comparison labels to read trends (“Last Month”, “Previous 30 Days”).
- Watch service market share to identify winners and laggards.

## Validation Checklist
- Cross-check a sample appointment against Total Revenue and AOV.
 - Verify your team’s timezone settings so “today” aligns with your local time.
- Check console for network errors during refresh.
